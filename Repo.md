# Mu Basecore Repo

This repository is considered foundational and fundamental to Project Mu. The guiding philosophy is that this code should be one or more of the following

* Part of the build system
* Common to any silicon architecture
* Part of the "API layer" that contains protocol and library definitions including
  * Industry Standards
  * UEFI Specifications
  * ACPI Specifications
* Part of the "PI" layer that contains driver dispatch logic, event/signaling logic, or memory management logic
  * This can also include central technologies like variable services
